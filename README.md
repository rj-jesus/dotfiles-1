# dotfiles
These are the dotfiles and Sublime Text 3 preferences and packages I use. It's a very simple repository. Feel free to do pull requests and other sugestions.

Just clone the contents of the repository to your ```$HOME``` folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/pbmartins/dotfiles ~/
```

Check my friend's repository from where I got some ideas:
