# dotfiles
These are the dotfiles and Sublime Text 3 preferences and packages I use. It's a very simple repository. Feel free to do pull requests and other sugestions.

Just clone the contents of the repository to your ```$HOME``` folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/pbmartins/dotfiles ~/
```

Don't forget to edit your git personal info using:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
```

Finally move Sublime Text files using:
```
mv ~/Preferences.sublime-settings ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User
mv ~/Package\ Control.sublime-settings ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/User
```

Check my friend's repository from where I got some ideas:
